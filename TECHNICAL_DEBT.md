## High Priority Issues

### 1. Refactor Broad Exception Handling in BasicOptimizationStrategy.run

**Issue**: The `BasicOptimizationStrategy.run` method uses overly broad exception handling that masks specific errors:

```python
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error in optimization: {str(e)}")
    raise OptimizationError(f"Optimization failed: {str(e)}")
```

**Problem**:
- Hides original exception types and stack traces
- Makes debugging difficult when specific library errors occur
- Masked the root cause of the MIPROv2 num_threads bug (TypeError)

**Recommended Solution**:
1. Replace broad `except Exception` with specific exception types
2. Add proper exception chaining to preserve original stack traces
3. Create specific exception types for different failure modes
4. Improve error messages to be more actionable

**Example Implementation**:
```python
try:
    # optimization logic
    pass
except TypeError as e:
    # Handle API misuse specifically
    raise OptimizationError(f"API configuration error: {str(e)}") from e
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle data validation errors
    raise OptimizationError(f"Invalid data provided: {str(e)}") from e
except Exception as e:
    # Only catch truly unexpected errors
    logging.error(f"Unexpected error in optimization: {str(e)}")
    logging.error(traceback.format_exc())
    raise OptimizationError(f"Unexpected optimization failure: {str(e)}") from e
```

**Priority**: High - directly impacts debugging and error diagnosis
**Effort**: Medium - requires careful analysis of all possible exception paths
**Impact**: High - improves maintainability and reduces time-to-resolution for future bugs

**Related to**: MIPROv2 num_threads bug fix (would have been caught immediately with proper exception handling)
